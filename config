# This is the configuration file for PowerNap.
# See powernap(1) for more information.

# This file is Python syntax, and will be sourced by the powernap daemon
# on start.
# To enact changes to this configuration, restart the daemon.

# Processes to monitor.
# The PROCESSES variable should be a Python list of quoted regular expressions.
# Each item in this list will be passed to: pgrep -f <item>
# Examples:
#   PROCESSES = [  "^/usr/bin/kvm", "sshd: " ]
#   PROCESSES = [  "^/usr/bin/mplayer", "^/usr/bin/xine", "^/usr/bin/mythfrontend" ]
PROCESSES = []

# Number of seconds that all processes must be absent from the process table.
# Example:
# ABSENT = 300
ABSENT = 300

# Quoted shell commands to run when all PROCESSES have been idle for IDLE time.
# Use "ps -eo args" to define these.
# Examples:
#   ACTION = "/usr/sbin/pm-suspend"
#   ACTION = "/usr/sbin/pm-hibernate"
#   ACTION = "/sbin/poweroff"
#   ACTION = "echo 'I am wasting electricity' | mail AlGore@example.com"
ACTION = ""

# Minimum run time of a process in the list of PROCESSES.
# The powernap daemon will wake every INTERVAL seconds and check the process
# table for matching processes.  Lower values of INTERVAL will provide more
# detailed process monitoring but will consume more system resources.  Higher
# values of INTERVAL will consume less system resources, but might miss
# processes that execute for less than INTERVAL seconds.
INTERVAL = 10
