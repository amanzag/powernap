Description: take a defined action when not running some specific processes
 PowerNap will run an administrator-specified ACTION when none of a list of
 PROCESSES have executed for some number of ABSENCE seconds, checking the
 process table every INTERVAL seconds.
.
 PowerNap can be used to bring a running system to a lower power state when
 none of a list of critical processes have run for some amount of time.  It
 can act as sort of a "screensaver" for servers, watching the process table
 for activity rather than the keyboard or mouse.
 .
 For instance, PowerNap can automatically "pm-suspend" a system if no instance of
 "kvm" runs for some contiguous block of "300" seconds, checking the process table
 every "10" seconds.
